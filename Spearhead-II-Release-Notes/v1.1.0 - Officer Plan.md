# v1.1.0 - Officer Plan

- All lower-tier officers (i.e. T1 and T2) now have had their upgrades reduced from 2 mutually exclusive offensive and 2 mutually exclusive defensive abilities to 2 maximum potential ability upgrades (1 offensive and 1 defensive) to reduce clutter, and these upgrades are globally toggleable.
  - Officers all have one offensive and one defensive ability.
    - The upgrade, being global, persists between officer deaths.
    - Not all doctrines offer a replacement ability upgrade, meaning that their officers will have fewer than 2 ability upgrades.
    - Swapping back to the original ability takes the same cost as swapping to the doctrinal ability.
    - All officers for the same faction will share the same non-doctrinal (default) offensive and defensive abilities.
  - All abilities share cooldown for each officer, meaning that an officer cannot use both an offensive and defensive ability at the same time.
    - The death of an officer will result in any currently active ability being cancelled with no refund.
  - All officers are now of poor training unless they have a combat retinue, which would grant them the same training as standard line infantry for the faction.
    - T1 officers generally are the only squads with combat retinues.
- All officers now have only 1 weapon upgrade instead of 2 to reduce menu clutter.
- The majority of officers no longer provide passive buffs.
  - Hotbar buffs have been removed and remnants of them can be found on officer active buffs.
  - Active buffs will almost always have situational utility, as there are very few buffs with no downsides.
  - Buffs cannot be stacked.
- T1 officers will mostly have tactical support abilities, such as mortar barrages.
- T2 officers will mostly have longer cooldown, strategic support abilities, such as artillery strikes.
- T3 officers will mostly have doctrine-specific active aura buffs. All buffs are mutually exclusive.
  - If the officer dies, the buff immediately ends with no refund.
- Each officer requires the previous tier(s) to be called in.
  - For example, calling in a T3 officer requires both the T1 and T2 officers to have been called in at least once before.
- Officers have had various price changes to account for either that a squad is inside a command vehicle or adjusted unit skills.

## Global

- Mark target now provides a modest accuracy and minor penetration buff against marked targets. Increased received damage removed.
